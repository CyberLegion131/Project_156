Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a critical complication of diabetes mellitus, often leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) if not detected early. This paper presents a deep learning-based system integrated with a continuous deployment (CD) pipeline for the early detection and monitoring of DN. By leveraging clinical datasets comprising patient-specific parameters, our model identifies early signs of DN with high precision. The integration of a CD pipeline facilitates seamless updates and automated deployment of model enhancements, minimizing human intervention while maintaining model reliability and efficiency. This approach aims to support healthcare professionals with rapid, consistent, and accurate diagnostic insights, ultimately improving clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.
